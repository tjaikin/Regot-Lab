# Regot-Lab
Code used by the Regot Lab

Use preprocessImagesCaller.py to call your imaging data from a folder "RawImages" and run through all preprocessing (preprocessing.py), flatfielding (flatfielding.py),and registration (registerAndCrop.py). This will result in an "Images" folder to be used for analysis in CellProfiler. Once you have output data from CellProfiler use trackOrganizeCpDataCaller.py to call output data and run tracking (trackOrganizeCpDataCaller.py).
